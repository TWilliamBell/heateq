Title: A Numerical Solver for One-Dimensional Heat Equations
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: This is mostly my way of fooling around with Rcpp, but this package includes an R and Rcpp example of numerical method of solving the one-dimensional heat equation.  The Rcpp version, which is to be preferred, is 22-166 times faster depending on the method you use.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.2)
